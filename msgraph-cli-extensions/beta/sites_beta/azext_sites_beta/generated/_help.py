            application-id: Identifier of the application used to create the subscription. Read-only.
            change-type: Required. Indicates the type of change in the subscribed resource that will raise a change \
notification. The supported values are: created, updated, deleted. Multiple values can be combined using a \
comma-separated list.Note: Drive root item and list change notifications support only the updated changeType. User and \
group change notifications support updated and deleted changeType.
            client-state: Optional. Specifies the value of the clientState property sent by the service in each change \
notification. The maximum length is 128 characters. The client can check that the change notification came from the \
service by comparing the value of the clientState property sent with the subscription with the value of the \
clientState property received with each change notification.
            creator-id: Identifier of the user or service principal that created the subscription. If the app used \
delegated permissions to create the subscription, this field contains the id of the signed-in user the app called on \
behalf of. If the app used application permissions, this field contains the id of the service principal corresponding \
to the app. Read-only.
            encryption-certificate: A base64-encoded representation of a certificate with a public key used to encrypt \
resource data in change notifications. Optional. Required when includeResourceData is true.
            encryption-certificate-id: A custom app-provided identifier to help identify the certificate needed to \
decrypt resource data. Optional.
            expiration-date-time: Required. Specifies the date and time when the webhook subscription expires. The \
time is in UTC, and can be an amount of time from subscription creation that varies for the resource subscribed to.  \
See the table below for maximum supported subscription length of time.
            include-resource-data: When set to true, change notifications include resource data (such as content of a \
chat message). Optional.
            latest-supported-tls-version: Specifies the latest version of Transport Layer Security (TLS) that the \
notification endpoint, specified by notificationUrl, supports. The possible values are: v1_0, v1_1, v1_2, v1_3. For \
subscribers whose notification endpoint supports a version lower than the currently recommended version (TLS 1.2), \
specifying this property by a set timeline allows them to temporarily use their deprecated version of TLS before \
completing their upgrade to TLS 1.2. For these subscribers, not setting this property per the timeline would result in \
subscription operations failing. For subscribers whose notification endpoint already supports TLS 1.2, setting this \
property is optional. In such cases, Microsoft Graph defaults the property to v1_2.
            lifecycle-notification-url: The URL of the endpoint that receives lifecycle notifications, including \
subscriptionRemoved and missed notifications. This URL must make use of the HTTPS protocol. Optional. Read more about \
how Outlook resources use lifecycle notifications.
            notification-url: Required. The URL of the endpoint that will receive the change notifications. This URL \
must make use of the HTTPS protocol.
            resource: Required. Specifies the resource that will be monitored for changes. Do not include the base URL \
(https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/). See the possible resource path values for each supported resource.
            id: Read-only.

            Multiple actions can be specified by using more than one --subscriptions argument.

            application-id: Identifier of the application used to create the subscription. Read-only.
            change-type: Required. Indicates the type of change in the subscribed resource that will raise a change \
notification. The supported values are: created, updated, deleted. Multiple values can be combined using a \
comma-separated list.Note: Drive root item and list change notifications support only the updated changeType. User and \
group change notifications support updated and deleted changeType.
            client-state: Optional. Specifies the value of the clientState property sent by the service in each change \
notification. The maximum length is 128 characters. The client can check that the change notification came from the \
service by comparing the value of the clientState property sent with the subscription with the value of the \
clientState property received with each change notification.
            creator-id: Identifier of the user or service principal that created the subscription. If the app used \
delegated permissions to create the subscription, this field contains the id of the signed-in user the app called on \
behalf of. If the app used application permissions, this field contains the id of the service principal corresponding \
to the app. Read-only.
            encryption-certificate: A base64-encoded representation of a certificate with a public key used to encrypt \
resource data in change notifications. Optional. Required when includeResourceData is true.
            encryption-certificate-id: A custom app-provided identifier to help identify the certificate needed to \
decrypt resource data. Optional.
            expiration-date-time: Required. Specifies the date and time when the webhook subscription expires. The \
time is in UTC, and can be an amount of time from subscription creation that varies for the resource subscribed to.  \
See the table below for maximum supported subscription length of time.
            include-resource-data: When set to true, change notifications include resource data (such as content of a \
chat message). Optional.
            latest-supported-tls-version: Specifies the latest version of Transport Layer Security (TLS) that the \
notification endpoint, specified by notificationUrl, supports. The possible values are: v1_0, v1_1, v1_2, v1_3. For \
subscribers whose notification endpoint supports a version lower than the currently recommended version (TLS 1.2), \
specifying this property by a set timeline allows them to temporarily use their deprecated version of TLS before \
completing their upgrade to TLS 1.2. For these subscribers, not setting this property per the timeline would result in \
subscription operations failing. For subscribers whose notification endpoint already supports TLS 1.2, setting this \
property is optional. In such cases, Microsoft Graph defaults the property to v1_2.
            lifecycle-notification-url: The URL of the endpoint that receives lifecycle notifications, including \
subscriptionRemoved and missed notifications. This URL must make use of the HTTPS protocol. Optional. Read more about \
how Outlook resources use lifecycle notifications.
            notification-url: Required. The URL of the endpoint that will receive the change notifications. This URL \
must make use of the HTTPS protocol.
            resource: Required. Specifies the resource that will be monitored for changes. Do not include the base URL \
(https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/). See the possible resource path values for each supported resource.
            id: Read-only.

subscribers whose notification endpoint supports a version lower than the currently recommended version (TLS 1.2), \
specifying this property by a set timeline allows them to temporarily use their deprecated version of TLS before \
completing their upgrade to TLS 1.2. For these subscribers, not setting this property per the timeline would result in \
subscription operations failing. For subscribers whose notification endpoint already supports TLS 1.2, setting this \
property is optional. In such cases, Microsoft Graph defaults the property to v1_2.

subscribers whose notification endpoint supports a version lower than the currently recommended version (TLS 1.2), \
specifying this property by a set timeline allows them to temporarily use their deprecated version of TLS before \
completing their upgrade to TLS 1.2. For these subscribers, not setting this property per the timeline would result in \
subscription operations failing. For subscribers whose notification endpoint already supports TLS 1.2, setting this \
property is optional. In such cases, Microsoft Graph defaults the property to v1_2.

            application-id: Identifier of the application used to create the subscription. Read-only.
            change-type: Required. Indicates the type of change in the subscribed resource that will raise a change \
notification. The supported values are: created, updated, deleted. Multiple values can be combined using a \
comma-separated list.Note: Drive root item and list change notifications support only the updated changeType. User and \
group change notifications support updated and deleted changeType.
            client-state: Optional. Specifies the value of the clientState property sent by the service in each change \
notification. The maximum length is 128 characters. The client can check that the change notification came from the \
service by comparing the value of the clientState property sent with the subscription with the value of the \
clientState property received with each change notification.

notification endpoint, specified by notificationUrl, supports. The possible values are: v1_0, v1_1, v1_2, v1_3. For \
subscribers whose notification endpoint supports a version lower than the currently recommended version (TLS 1.2), \
specifying this property by a set timeline allows them to temporarily use their deprecated version of TLS before \
completing their upgrade to TLS 1.2. For these subscribers, not setting this property per the timeline would result in \
subscription operations failing. For subscribers whose notification endpoint already supports TLS 1.2, setting this \
property is optional. In such cases, Microsoft Graph defaults the property to v1_2.

            application-id: Identifier of the application used to create the subscription. Read-only.
            change-type: Required. Indicates the type of change in the subscribed resource that will raise a change \
notification. The supported values are: created, updated, deleted. Multiple values can be combined using a \
comma-separated list.Note: Drive root item and list change notifications support only the updated changeType. User and \
group change notifications support updated and deleted changeType.
            client-state: Optional. Specifies the value of the clientState property sent by the service in each change \
notification. The maximum length is 128 characters. The client can check that the change notification came from the \
service by comparing the value of the clientState property sent with the subscription with the value of the \
clientState property received with each change notification.

notification endpoint, specified by notificationUrl, supports. The possible values are: v1_0, v1_1, v1_2, v1_3. For \
subscribers whose notification endpoint supports a version lower than the currently recommended version (TLS 1.2), \
specifying this property by a set timeline allows them to temporarily use their deprecated version of TLS before \
completing their upgrade to TLS 1.2. For these subscribers, not setting this property per the timeline would result in \
subscription operations failing. For subscribers whose notification endpoint already supports TLS 1.2, setting this \
property is optional. In such cases, Microsoft Graph defaults the property to v1_2.
            lifecycle-notification-url: The URL of the endpoint that receives lifecycle notifications, including \
subscriptionRemoved and missed notifications. This URL must make use of the HTTPS protocol. Optional. Read more about \
